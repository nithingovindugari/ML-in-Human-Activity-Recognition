# Machine Learning in Human Activity Recognition

## Project Overview
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphones is an area of active research in ubiquitous computing. This project aims to apply various machine learning techniques to recognize activities from sensor data collected from smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of sensor data collected from a group of participants performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone. The sensors capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate.

## Objective
The primary objective is to train machine learning models that can accurately predict the activity performed by the user based on sensor data inputs.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Scaling features, handling missing values, and normalizing the sensor data.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from raw data that can help in improving the model's performance.
- Model Training: Building and training machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc.
- Evaluation: Assessing the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Creating visual representations of the data and results to better understand the models' performance.

## File Descriptions
- `data_ingestion.py`: Contains code for loading and initial processing of data.
- `data_transformation.py`: Script for data normalization and feature engineering.
- `model_training.py`: Includes machine learning model definitions and training procedures.
- `model_evaluation.py`: For evaluating model performance and reporting metrics.
- `data_visualization.py`: Code for generating various plots and charts to visualize the data and results.

## Results
